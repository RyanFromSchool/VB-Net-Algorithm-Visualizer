# VB.Net Algorithm Visualizer 1.0


## Description  
This is an algorithm visualizer written in VB.net. It is a very simple program whose purpose is to familiarize myself with the syntax of VB.Net while also learning about different types of algorithms. Currently in version 1.0 it runs Dijkstra's algorithm. There is no guarantee that this will be updated.


#### Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Randomly generates nodes and edges
* The source node will be SeaGreen while the subsequent nodes are printed in Maroon
* Red edges indicated a possible edge, Blue indicates that the edge is part of the solution
* Sometimes a Node will generate with no edges assigned to it
* Sometimes the source will not connect to any other nodes, so there will be no solution
